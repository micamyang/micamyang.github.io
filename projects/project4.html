            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>
              This project aimed to design and simulate an integrated network infrastructure using a Cisco Packet Tracer virtual environment, 
              connecting multiple domestic and international branches (United States, Busan, Berlin, Jeju) and a central data centre. 
              The primary objective was to build a secure and efficient virtual communication environment that would ensure stable network connectivity 
              and enhanced traffic security between the branches and the data centre without relying on physical equipment.
            </p>

            <h2>My Role</h2>
            <p>
              I was responsible for establishing and configuring the network for the Berlin branch. 
              This involved designing and setting up a network within the Cisco Packet Tracer environment that met the specific requirements 
              of the Berlin office. Through active collaboration and communication with team members, I contributed to ensuring smooth 
              network functionality within the virtual system. This process allowed me to gain a deeper understanding of complex network structures 
              and their real-world applicability through hands-on simulation and problem-solving. 
              In particular, it was a valuable opportunity to strengthen my understanding of routing concepts and practical implementation through a virtual simulator.
            </p>

            <h2>Result</h2>
            <p>
              The project successfully connected the headquarters, all branch offices, and the data centre within the Cisco Packet Tracer simulation environment. 
              A secure and stable virtual communication network was achieved using Site-to-Site VPN and static routing configuration. 
              This experience was a significant opportunity to demonstrate my ability to design and troubleshoot complex network topologies 
              without relying on physical infrastructure.
