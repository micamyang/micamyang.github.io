            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>
              This project involved developing a game using Python and the Pygame library in collaboration with a team. 
              As the project manager (PM) and team lead, I oversaw the entire process, from game planning to documentation. 
              I implemented key components including the user interface (UI), character mechanics, ranking system and difficulty settings, 
              resulting in the successful completion of a playable game demo.

            <h2>My Role</h2>
            <p>Project management (PM) and game UI implementation.</p>

            <h2>Result</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Functional game demo development</strong></li>
                <p>
                    Developed a fully functional demo including menus, game-over screens, character HP and special skill gauges, 
                    item selection, and character animations. Integrated difficulty scaling, hit detection, projectile and monster logic 
                    to create a smooth gameplay experience.
                </p>

                <li><strong>Scoreboard system implementation</strong></li>
                <p>
                    Built a scoreboard system that calculates final scores based on the number of enemies defeated, difficulty level, 
                    cleared stages, and remaining time. The score is clearly displayed on the game-over and stage-clear screens, 
                    increasing the sense of achievement for players.
                </p>

                <li><strong>Efficient project management and teamwork</strong></li>
                <p>
                    As PM, I took the lead in drafting the game plan and documentation, coordinating team roles, 
                    and ensuring smooth communication. This demonstrated both my ability to manage a team effectively 
                    and my practical experience in Python-based game development.
