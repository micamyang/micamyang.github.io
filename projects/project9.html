        <section>
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>
              This project involved building a CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment) pipeline using Jenkins on AWS EC2 infrastructure. 
              The pipeline automated the entire process from detecting GitHub code changes, to automated builds, image creation, 
              and deployment to multiple servers (headquarters EC2 Tomcat and Docker Tomcat servers in Germany and Japan). 
              The project aimed to establish an efficient development and deployment process while enhancing overall service reliability.
            </p>

            <h2>My Role</h2>
            <p>
              I was responsible for Jenkins deployment and managing the Docker Tomcat environment for the German branch, playing a key role in the automation process.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Jenkins deployment and CI/CD pipeline configuration</strong></li>
              <p>
                Set up the Jenkins server and integrated it with GitHub Webhooks to detect code changes in real time. 
                Oversaw the entire process of automated builds, Docker image creation, and deployment to multiple servers.
              </p>

              <li><strong>German branch service deployment and management</strong></li>
              <p>
                Deployed the application to the Dockerised Tomcat environment for the German branch and ensured stable service operation. 
                Configured AWS security groups (port 8083) to allow external access, taking responsibility for the deployment environment of the German branch.
              </p>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Result</h2>
            <p>
              Following the automated deployment through Jenkins, the Tomcat web applications at headquarters, the German branch, 
              and the Japanese branch were successfully launched and visually confirmed using the Tomcat Web Application Manager.
            </p>
