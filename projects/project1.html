            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>
              We developed an Android mobile application that enables users to search for potential diseases based on their pets’ symptoms 
              and record their health conditions. The application was designed with a clean and intuitive user interface, allowing pet owners 
              to easily manage health information and detect signs of illness at an early stage. The final APK was distributed to test users, 
              and we received positive feedback regarding its usability and functionality.
            </p>

            <h2>My Role</h2>
            <p>
              I was responsible for leading the project planning and presentation, designing the app architecture and implementing the core features 
              (disease search and symptom recording). I created the dataset and developed an automated parsing system, designed the overall UX/UI, 
              and led both the user survey and analysis.
