            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>
              This project established a Kali Linux environment and executed realistic attack scenarios against a deliberately vulnerable Metasploitable server in order to perform system penetration testing. 
              By analysing the attack processes and collecting the generated logs, we identified potential security weaknesses and gathered practical data necessary for developing effective defence strategies.
            </p>

            <h2>My Role</h2>
            <p>
              I led the execution of attack scenarios using Kali and conducted penetration tests designed to elicit relevant logs, driving the core security assessment process.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Kali Linux setup and attack execution</strong></li>
              <p>
                Installed and configured the Kali Linux distribution and prepared the environment to utilise various penetration-testing tools. 
                I targeted the Metasploitable server to perform realistic access and intrusion scenarios.
              </p>

              <li><strong>Vulnerability analysis and log elicitation</strong></li>
              <p>
                Through active exploitation attempts, I identified vulnerabilities in the Metasploitable server and intentionally generated and captured system logs at each attack phase to simulate traces left by real incidents.
              </p>

              <li><strong>Review and analysis of attack logs</strong></li>
              <p>
                After the penetration tests, I thoroughly reviewed the system and network logs produced by the attacks to assess the impact and to pinpoint weaknesses in the defence mechanisms.
              </p>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Result</h2>
            <p>
              The simulated penetration tests using Kali Linux successfully exposed multiple vulnerabilities within the Metasploitable server and demonstrated feasible attack vectors. 
              Detailed logs were collected and analysed for each attack stage, enabling a clear understanding of potential attack paths and forensic artefacts, and providing actionable insights to strengthen defences.
