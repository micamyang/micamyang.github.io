            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>
              This project focused on building and configuring a lightweight Flask-based web service within a Microservices Architecture (MSA) environment. 
              By integrating Redis and MySQL, the system supported various user flows including login, registration, and session management. 
              Through functional separation into individual microservices, we established a web service architecture that is both easy to maintain and highly scalable.
            </p>

        <section>
            <h2>My Role</h2>
            <p>
              I was responsible for the design, configuration and operation of the core Flask web service within the project.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Flask web service implementation</strong></li>
              <p>
                Developed a lightweight Flask-based web service and containerised it to create a standalone microservice separated 
                from the front-end and user services.
              </p>

              <li><strong>Service integration</strong></li>
              <p>
                Established seamless communication between the Flask web service, Redis, and MySQL within the MSA environment, 
                successfully implementing user login, registration verification, and session persistence across services.
              </p>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Result</h2>
            <p>
              The Flask-based web service integrated reliably with Redis and MySQL within the MSA environment, 
              successfully supporting various user flows such as login, registration, and session management (e.g. performance search and ticket booking). 
              This demonstrated the practical advantages of a microservices structure, including improved maintainability and scalability.
            </p>
