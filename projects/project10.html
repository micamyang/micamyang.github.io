            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>
              The aim of this project was to build and utilise an Orchestrator solution to maximise operational efficiency in a complex system environment. 
              By automating and integrating various previously manual operational processes, the solution contributed to significantly improving both system stability and operational efficiency.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>My Role</h2>
            <p>
              As the Orchestrator lead, I played a central role in designing and implementing key automation and integrated management processes within the project.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Design and implementation of the Orchestrator solution</strong></li>
              <p>
                Analysed the overall automation requirements and designed an optimal Orchestrator solution. 
                The system was structured to handle process automation and ensure seamless integration between multiple systems and services.
              </p>

              <li><strong>Automation of operational workflows</strong></li>
              <p>
                Automated complex operational workflows that had previously been performed manually, such as build, deployment, monitoring, 
                and disaster recovery (DR) procedures for specific services. 
                This reduced human error and significantly improved execution speed.
              </p>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Result</h2>
            <p>
              The successful implementation of the Orchestrator solution automated numerous previously manual operational steps, 
              substantially enhancing the efficiency of both development and operational processes. 
              This strengthened the stability of system deployment and management, ultimately contributing to improved service availability.
