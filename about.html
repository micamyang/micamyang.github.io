        <p>
          I’m <strong>Micaela Sinn</strong>, an aspiring security engineer with a multidisciplinary background 
          in computer engineering and translation studies from Hankuk University of Foreign Studies (HUFS). 
          During my studies, I balanced technical coursework and team projects in app and web development 
          and machine learning with five years of experience teaching English — an experience that honed 
          my communication and collaboration skills across diverse teams. I also spent a semester as an exchange student at the University of Würzburg in Germany, 
          and served as president of the German Language Society for two years, overseeing the production of the society's academic journal.
        </p>

        <p>
          As part of my academic work, I applied a predictive machine learning model to perform experiments, 
          which formed the basis of a research paper I co-authored. 
          After graduation, I completed a six-month government-sponsored security engineering programme 
          where I worked on hands-on, production-oriented projects. My practical experience includes 
          containerised deployments using Docker, AWS security projects, and penetration-testing labs 
          with Burp Suite, Kali Linux, Security Onion, and WebGoat. I am particularly drawn to offensive 
          security (red teaming / ethical hacking) and have a growing interest in cryptography — 
          including post-quantum cryptography (PQC).
        </p>

        <p>
          I enjoy working at the intersection of infrastructure, cloud, and application security: 
          automating secure deployments, detecting anomalies, and hardening systems against real-world threats. 
          I am outgoing by nature, enjoy working in team environments, and bring curiosity and persistence to solving 
          technical challenges. Outside of work, I practise kendo, take long walks, and study languages — I am fluent in English and Korean, 
          have intermediate proficiency in Japanese and German, and have basic knowledge of Spanish, French, and Swedish.
        </p>

        <p>
          I am actively seeking opportunities to contribute to security teams where I can apply my 
          practical tooling experience, further develop my red-team skills, and explore cryptographic research 
          in applied settings.
